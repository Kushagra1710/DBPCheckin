    <p><strong>Last updated: January 02, 2026</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how DBPCheckin ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). DBPCheckin is an attendance management application designed for organizational use.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information to provide and improve our services:</p>

    <h3>A. Personal Information</h3>
    <p>When you register or use the App, we may collect personal details such as:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Phone Number</li>
        <li>Department/Group Assignment</li>
        <li>Seating/Office Location</li>
        <li>Profile Photograph</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Biometric Data (Face Data)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Collection:</strong> We use your device's camera to capture facial images during the attendance marking process.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This data is used exclusively for <strong>identity verification</strong> and <strong>liveness detection</strong> to prevent attendance spoofing.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Facial embeddings (mathematical representations of your face) are generated and stored securely in our database to match against future attendance attempts. The original images may also be stored for audit purposes by the organization's administrators.</li>
        <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Face data is retained as long as you are an active member of the organization using the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Location Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Collection:</strong> We collect your precise location (GPS coordinates) when you mark your attendance.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To verify that you are physically present within the authorized geofenced area (e.g., office premises) assigned to your group/department.</li>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> Location data is accessed only when you are using the App to mark attendance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Device Information</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Device model and manufacturer</li>
        <li>Operating system version</li>
        <li>Unique device identifiers (for security and binding the account to a device)</li>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Attendance Tracking:</strong> To record your daily check-in and check-out times.</li>
        <li><strong>Identity Verification:</strong> To ensure that the person marking attendance is the registered employee (using Face Recognition).</li>
        <li><strong>Location Validation:</strong> To ensure attendance is marked from an authorized location.</li>
        <li><strong>Administration:</strong> To allow administrators to manage employee profiles, view attendance logs, and approve/reject registration requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> To detect and prevent fraud, such as spoofing attempts using photos or videos.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Permissions Required</h2>
    <p>The App requires the following permissions to function correctly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Required for capturing your photo for face recognition and liveness detection.</li>
        <li><strong>Location (Fine & Coarse):</strong> Required to verify your physical location during attendance marking.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet:</strong> Required to communicate with our secure servers (Supabase/Firebase) to store and retrieve data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Organization Administrators:</strong> Your attendance records, location data, and profile information are accessible to the administrators of your organization (e.g., HR, Managers) for monitoring and management purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use third-party services (e.g., Supabase, Firebase) for data hosting and authentication. These providers are bound by confidentiality agreements and data protection laws.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not sell your personal or biometric data to third parties.</strong></p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data is transmitted over secure SSL/TLS connections.</li>
        <li>Access to sensitive data is restricted to authorized personnel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
